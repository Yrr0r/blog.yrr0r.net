#### Pre-class:

“This was the first time the police in Western Europe had received authority to act on its own, to rule directly over people; in one sphere of pub- lic life it was no longer an instrument to carry out and enforce the law, but had become a ruling authority independent of government and ministries.” (Hannah, 1951: 365)

One important thing to notice in here is the cause of the increase of police power. The refugee, or the state-less, is essentially a stranger to the ideology of the state. The political system of the states before the war essentially rely on their common ideology to sustain its operation. The core value, and the essential basement of this ideology is build upon the narrative of nation, which is a common context shared by all citizens. The refugee problem, which still exist to this day, is essentially about identity politics, and not only refugees, similar situations appear even during peaceful time, any group or person that do not share the same ideology will at the risk of being prosecuted. The purpose of increased police power is to maintain the integrity of the identity, in addition to maintain the law, as a mean to force the people within the same state to be bounded with only one ultimate interest (the nation in such context unites because of such interest). Many countries in the 21th centuries still utilise this way to strip rights from illegal immigrants and minority groups as they simply do not believe they share the same national identity. 



#### Post-class:

“The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool's freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow.” (Hannah, 1951: 376)

This important aspect is how rights is implemented, or conducted. The Versailles Treaty has acknowledged the rights of refugees in the text, but the truth is, rights are not being enforced by the text, but by people who are said to enforce that right. If rights exist on paper but not a real right, it’s very questionable if that right exist at all, and this question does not go away with the refugees. It has become a universal problem of human rights. The implication of this is, when a person is said to have certain rights, then such rights, and other rights that these rights depends on, must be in accessible. For example, if a person is said to have the freedom of speech, then he must be protected from any threat to his free expressions, and his life must also be protected so he will not trade this right for survival. 

From this point of view, the current status of human rights, even in developed countries, are under great risk to become only exist on paper. When the price of real estates has sky-rocketed, the need of having a roof is no longer a right, but becomes a privilege for those who can afford it. If a person purchased a mobile phone, when the manufacturer puts forward a planned obsolescence, then his right to own his property, becomes a lease to the manufacturer. Same reasoning can go on with almost every rights: they becomes only rights on paper, but privilege in real life.
