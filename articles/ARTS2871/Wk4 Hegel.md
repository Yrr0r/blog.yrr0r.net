## Wk4 Hegel



#### Pre-class

“This movement of self-consciousness in relation to another self-consciousness … has the double significance of being both its own action and the action of the others as well.”(Hegel, 1977: 111)

The one being can distinguish itself, in the relation of other being and things. He found out that things are incapable of being, and other beings not only capable of being, but are the being to his same kind and capability. It is possible to demonstrate one’s being to any other being or things by interacting with them and observe the effect, i.e. speaking to another person to hear him response, or drawing on a notebook to see the marks of pen. Demonstration of being can be done to any thing or being, however, if one wish to **express** his being, he can only do so to a same capable being, because things are incapable of acknowledgement: pen traces on paper does not reply this interaction in the same meaningful level, no actual meaning is created from an external source. 

Bringing this understanding to the master-slave context, it brings a question: does slaves still acknowledge the master, if he does not willing to? When masters force the slave to do work, not for themselves, but to please the masters, they lost the acknowledgement from the slaves in exchange for it. The slaves, under the fear and force, turn this true acknowledgement to appreciation of their own creation of work (even if it’s not for their good, but they can appreciate the process), and their acknowledgement to masters began to loss its meaning, as the slaves no longer wish to create these meaning in their acknowledgements and it become more resembling the pen traces on the paper. 



#### Post-class

The most important question of the master-slave relation seems to be whether the master-slave relationship can sustain its role — whether masters are still masters, if slaves do not produce any meaningful response to that, and when slaves begin to appreciate each other and their creation, they become more capable than slaves. Also in this context, the work should be defined as creation to distinguish from meaningless labour. It may seems the work done by slaves is for pleasing their master, but the masters only own their work, but not their creation. In this sense, the slaves become rather more creative than masters. 

If the relationship develops beyond this stage, it begins to deconstruct. The masters, as they want to become more complete beings, will search for the real meaning and relationship, and join the slave’s work and movement. This reason can explain how men can also become feminists. They both realise that the master-slave is a constraint to the real relationship and when they both seek freedom, they seek the freedom for others as well. And for the same reason, a man in search for true love will search for a complete relationship which is free from the constraints of fear. In order for the master to enjoy the creation of slave’s work, he must not be a master, and masters who wants to enjoy the slave’s work instead of the demonstration of power, will share the creation of it, and therefore no longer a master.
