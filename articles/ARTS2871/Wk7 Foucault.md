## Week 7 Foucault



#### Pre-class



"An execution that affects life rather than the body." (Foucault, 1977: 12) This sentence basically concluded the changing in forms of punishment. Body is the form of life, or its appearance - which means that previous way of punishment exerted onto body is not as inclusive as the modernised way of punishment on life. From this perspective, even though punishments seems to be more humane and less bloodily, it become more effective. Modern punishments seems to recognised this and treated the body not as an ultimate target of punishment, but as a mean that delivers the punishment to the owner of the body - the soul/mind. This changed the purpose of punishment. The present way of prison is a method that attempts to deliver the punishment onto the mind, which as Foucault already suggested - a mental-judicial treatment. The punishment, in this context, seems to rather be clinical: a correction, or a rectification to the soul to force them behave in the expected manner. 



On the expansion of this idea, it can indeed be questioned that, whether it is a prison for the criminals to stay, or a mental hospital, or whether the prison is a form of mental hospital and vice versa, as they can serve the same purpose. In reality, these two types of organisations formed a complement with conflicting overlaps. For example, homosexual behaviour was once illegal and can leads to the person being imprisoned, and there also exists mental clinics that claims to "correct homosexual behaviour". In many occasions they are the two sides of the coin: a crime is caused by an irregular mental activity, therefore the crime is ultimately caused by a mental illness, then prison and mental hospital are equivalent to this extent. 





#### Post-class

The prison and mental hospital have many things in common, they both focus on bending the person’s mind, in the purpose of producing the expected behaviour. The measures in the prison and mental hospitals starts to apply outside in the entire society. The essential of prison is to produce the feeling of constraint, as the inmates only know they can potentially be watched, but not sure when. Nowadays security cameras covers most places and produce the same purpose.

Even though during most time there will be no security guards watching the live footage from the camera and the archived footage will likely never be reviewed again, people under this surveillance still have to pretend and act as if there are guards watching. The entire population are being viewed and recorded, regardless of how many of them are potential criminals. And there is an interesting argument in defending this system: A good person does not feel guilty being watched, only the malicious one does, hence a good person has no reason to protest against being watched. This is the exact expected outcome of the correct behaviour: the person is willingly to do the correct behaviour and use it to discipline themselves. 

Furthermore, surveillance is not the only way to produce this internalised discipline, a potentially more effective mean is to directly evaluate of level of discipline. People are required to perform certain kind of task, and the outcome is being assessed to rate the person’s ability. In school exams, job interviews, court and many other situations the personality is being judged on how he discipline himself to produce the corrected behaviour during the whole process of preparation. Even though he knows he is not being watched, he clearly understands that he has to act as if he is being watched (or self-watched) so at the end he will produce the expected outcome.
