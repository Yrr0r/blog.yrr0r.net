# Week 2 - Durkheim

## Pre-class

In many modern society, private education service can cover age as young as 3 or 4, and in many under-developed countries its not uncommon to see a person receiving education in a much older age than age of school. Furthermore, in many schools, morality is not a primary content delivered to children, many school values math and language more important to be delivered to children and morality is a rather implicit element that the children learns themselves. I would question that, rather seen morality as a element taught by teachers in school, its can more likely to be sentiments that is implicitly formed by the socializing inside the school, and what delivered by teachers is rather knowledge on morality than practice of morality. If a children did not grew up receiving education from school, they might be missing the knowledge on morality, but still having the practice as they still have plenty socialization with other people, and they still discipline themselves as other do.

*"The fundamental element of morality is the spirit of discipline."* (Durkheim, p.31) Discipline is how morality is applied. One discipline themselves to behave in a moral manner, and if they fail to discipline, other people will condemn to enforce they discipline themselves. On the positive side, it might reduce chaos in the society, but it also have a significant drawback -- this can lead one to fight against, and even suppress their own will. When a person has a personality that is considered not very acceptable (immoral), they must discipline themselves against this personality to comply with overall morality, For example, a gay person will have to secretly conceal evidence of their sexuality and pretend to be straight when the society they live in does not consider homosexuality to be moral.

## Post-Class

As a predetermined condition for this context, morality exist and is innate. It would also imply that morality applies the same to all human being, regardless of their identity or what sub-group they are in. Which also implies society exist and is higher than each individual. Individual person may die, but society is immortal. It seems that Durkheim attempts to recognize morality as what disciplines a person to be an altruist for the entire mankind. However, this entirely collectivism approach can be questionable. It would be unclear that, if one's ultimate goal is to serve the interest of entire society, what would that interest be, and who would be deciding that interest -- whether it's the person serving them, or those who being served, as the person who serve others is also being served by the others. If we assume people are not selfish trying to convince other to serve their own interest, the interest of "others" may simply just be to let everyone to eventually serve the interest of themselves, which seems to be a paradox.

In reality, situation seems far from Durkheim's perfect world. A universal common good for society might not exist, as society is so divided into different sub-groups and sub-cultures, serving the good for a sub-group may be against the entire population, and vice versa. the common good of society is rather scoped in  its context than universal (otherwise nations would obviously be immoral). 



# Week 3 Max Weber

## Pre-class:

Max and Durkheim both seems has a negative opinion on revolution. In many cases, even not officially recognized, but any leaders in protest, or anyone who organizes people to form a community, can also be implied politicians and are potential users of violence. With this in mind, Max's definition on politician seems to be a ideal case of **authority**, not just anyone who involves in politics. In real life, It's more common that politicians are never this ideal. In the reality of corrupted politics of modern society, politicians are rarely self-disciplined to follow any guidelines to be a good politician. Instead, the modern society attempts to admit this issue and created a system that the passion and interest of politicians are bounded with the society. In the ideal case of the system, the politicians must serve other's interest in order to serve their own interest. The validity of this bonding still remains questionable.

A politician, even free from this selfishness, still face a problem of his good intention distorted into a evil outcome. *"No system of ethics in the world can avoid facing the fact that ‘good’ ends in many cases can be achieved only at the price of morally dubious means..."*(Weber, p.) It is common in history that many political power rise with the intention of freedom of the workers or people, and later become a dictatorship regime similar to Soviet Union. The use of power only justify itself when it serves it's initial purpose. When a politician claims to "solve the homelessness issue" by forcing homeless people out of city instead of providing them with proper living space would be a perfect example of means and ends does not justify each other, and eventually turned into a display of power. 

## Post-class

The society gives ordinary people an impression of what is a good politician by Weber's definitions, with the means of moral education and ideological propaganda. Although a perfect politician does not seems to be possible, there are standards and impressions between people who these politicians ask support from. In most democracy, or even not so democratic systems, it is a very common practice for politicians to demonstrate that their power comes from the authorization of people they serve, and therefore a source of legitimacy to their political decisions. In this system, regardless of who's interest is desired by the politician, all their decisions must, at least appears to, be made on behalf of ordinary people.

In the modern politic context, there is another point which Weber did not mention at all -- politics is a participation of everyone. *"Politics is made with head, not with other parts of body or soul."* (Weber, p.213) Weber tends to define a perfect elite politician -- a ideal decision machine which is free from self and emotion(other parts of body), making decision only with logic and evaluation(head). In reality, the society rather attempts to avoid this. Contemporary democracies emphasize the participance of each individuals and politician should only represent and mediate them instead of make real decisions. In this perspective, the politician enshrined by modern society has a major difference from Weber's perfect politician -- they should not make decision on their own, but they still share the same sins.
