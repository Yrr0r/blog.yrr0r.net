This is my static blog. It's constantly under development and evolving. I wrote this page generator myself. Visit the site to read rendered articles. 



## Build and test commands:

- Compile the site: `npm run build`

- Formatting files and adding front-matter: `npm run fmt`

- Preview site without writing anything to disk: `npm run preview`

- Compile the CSS assets: `npm run style`   

- Just testing the compiler core: `npm run test`
