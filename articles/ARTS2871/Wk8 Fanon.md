## Wk8 Fanon

#### Pre-class:

“The black man among his own in the twentieth century does not know at what moment his inferiority comes into being through the other.” (Fanon, 2008: 83) The blackness was not defined by black people. Before white people began to colonise Africa, black people were still there, but not their blackness. If we ask any black person before the age of colonialism, what is blackness and whiteness, he would most likely not know, because the meaning of being a black person is defined by white people. He do not know his inferiority, because it's given by whiteness.

This blackness and whiteness reminded me of a similar comparable order: sexuality. Both operates in a very similar way: racism is based on the inferiority defined by white people, and sexism is based on the inferiority defined by male. Both are split into two groups, a superior one and an inferior one. And the most importantly, in both cases, the two groups have a fixed and predetermined role in the society, resembling servants and masters. At this point, it becomes clear that, the biological difference is irrelevant to the actual power that operates in the system. It is only a reference, a standard, or a story that the power tells introduces people to distinguish between “us” and “they” and introduce them to this context. After that, this standard becomes autonomously enforced by the power behind it. Fanon mentioned there were attempts to produce a serum for whitening a black person so he can get rid of racism, but this is rather more likely an enforce and not a liberation — it never changed the order of racism, but rather acknowledged that the inferiority is caused by the black skin.



#### Post-class:

"I wanted to be typically Negro—it was no longer possible. I wanted to be white—that was a joke.” (Fanon, 2008: 101) 

Because black is no longer a word that only describe a colour, it now has a political meaning. And it’s impossible to become that pure black — the black without blackness. Since colonists invented racism, it was applied onto not only black people, but everyone inside the context so that everyone has no choice but to accept it. When black people become sufferer, it implies a condition that everyone inside that context are racists, which still partially holds true today. Within the racism narrative, it was simply not designed to respect a person’s choice — being black or not was predetermined inside one’s genetical expression. There is no way to escape from racism other than escape or changing the narrative of power, since power already transformed people into its servants.

This reminds me of an analogy: Paper is made from trees, but paper are no longer trees. Similarly, racism has transformed people into black and white, but they are no longer people with simply different appearance, but inhumane beings that disregard the diverse possibility of independent individuals and maintain the morality of their own groups. 

I can imagine a black teacher teaching a black student to discipline himself because he "represents the black people”. I can also imagine parents teaching a girl how to dress up so she “looks like a girl”. People inside these contexts are no longer themselves, but becomes a part of a greater group of an ideology.
