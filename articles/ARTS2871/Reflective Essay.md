## Reflective Essay



I had some extra thoughts when writing workbook entries on Hegel and Foucault. The first one is that liberation is a two-sided dualism that encompasses both the people in power and the people who are powerless. The world is not binary in the sense of people in power and people who are powerless.

Taking feminism as an example, when feminists are struggling for women’s rights, there are many conservatives who are against this idea and claims feminism is against men. And when people start to question whether feminism is really against men, it can be answered by asking another question: Can men also become feminists and is there any good reason to do so? The answer is obviously yes. And when I begin to think about the reason behind, it become apparent that what I and feminism are against are not men, but the way they exercise their power. This idea also inspired me on understanding why there are both men and women who are against feminism and it seems that the reason of being a feminist does not necessarily associate to any specific gender, but the identity behind it. 

“The action has a double significance not only because it is directed against itself as well as against the other, but also because it is indivisibly the action of one as well as of the other.” (Hegel, 1977: 112)

Liberation from bondage does not affect only one side, it must affect the both for a meaningful acknowledgement. The same should apply to bondage, as the creation of master rely on the creation of slave and vice versa. This means, not only liberation can effect both the master and bondsman, but a bondage is the same thing done in reverse. Not only a man can reasonably become a feminist, but a woman can also not be a feminist for the exact reason. In this context, a feminism propaganda that targets women by making them identify as women (i.e. they should become feminist because they are female) can actually be misleading, because feminism is not associated to the gender, but the operation of power behind it, and hence the propaganda should not enshrine the identity of gender, but to enshrine getting rid of it. This is a common misconception most identity politics, including sexism, racism, nationalism and any other similar operation of power — identity over real beings.

It’s important to understand that, from this perspective, the ultimate purpose of feminism becomes to free people from the constraint of gender, and focus on real people instead of their identity. The same reasoning applies to racism and nationalism as well. The purpose of identity politics is to abstract a free being into a identity they bear, and this identity not only represent them, but also become a constraint that they have to maintain, for it is a now a incomplete symbol that represents the whole person. 

Now it is more apparent that liberation is not only about freeing those with the identity of slave, but to stop individual people to become a symbolised identity, therefore it becomes not only a matter of the bondsman, but a matter for everyone since both sides are required to form a synthesis. From this point of view, friendship becomes a powerful weapon against identity, for it recognises the person entirely and not only the role-playing identity that he maintains. 

The most important thing from this experience is to see many social movements as attempts to reach the synthesis, not just one group fighting over the other’s domination. In this perspective, it is always meaningful to ask, what can the movement brings to all of us, instead of just one specific group? In the example of feminism, men who embrace feminism also benefit from it. Even though I may not be any specific minority group or that victim of oppression, but seeing things in this critical way becomes beneficial to understand ourselves better and see how we are also related and involved.

The other one is an unfinished discussion on the form of prison in Foucault’s context. It seems that, the purpose of prison is to constraint the freedom of inmates, but the function of prison is not only provided within the prison. There are many forms of constraint that does not need to be done in a centrally built space, for example, in some strict lockdowns during COVID, a person can be forced to stay at home. His freedom of movement is severely confined and the feeling of confinement is strongly present even he is not inside the prison. On the other hand, there are also humanitarian prisons, for example, the Halden Prison in Norway, which was designed to be friendly to prisoners and reduce the sense of punishment, and focus on social rehabilitation rather than confinement. 

From this point of view, the question becomes that, rather than focus on how the operation of prison is improved to better discipline and convert the inmates, we may focus on where the actual prison is, even if there is not a place built specifically to be a prison. No matter whether the purpose is to punish or to rehabilitate, imprisonment is only one form of it and does not necessarily have to be done within a purposely built space, and prison is not the only space that can restrict the freedom of a person, thus questioning whether there is still a need for prison. 

It seems that, instead of having discrete prisons to house the inmates, the society can also integrate the features of a prison and discipline is distributed everywhere inside. Restricting the accessibility of individuals based on their behaviour can become the equivalent of prison cells, and this can sometimes be a more refined way of punishment — the punishment can be very little to punish a less severe crime. For example, a person can be rejected to enter a shopping mall if he was caught stealing, but he still has the freedom to access other places and socialise so the punishment is a very accurate response to the behaviour and less severely impact the person — the punishment now becomes atomic. Furthermore, a video on the social credit system in China was shown in the tutorial session on Foucault, even though there is no evidence to prove it is real, but a similar system for a different purpose is already operational in China to evaluate the financial capability and used to decide the amount of loan to a person. The introduction of numerical score to the punishment system can greatly increase the feeling of being monitored. 

Ultimately, this socially integrated punishment will inevitably assume everyone are potential criminals. This is a result of removing the prison but not removing the crimes — the logic of correcting individual unexpected behaviour still exist. 

An important aspect I learned from Foucault is the criticality of seeing the power disguise itself. Foucault questioned whether transition from cruel punishment to less-violent prison is a progress of humanity, and many other reforms and movements can be questioned in the same way — whether are they truly a progressive liberation, or another reinforce of power disguised under the name of reform. From these questioning, the true purpose of a certain kind of movement can be seen.
