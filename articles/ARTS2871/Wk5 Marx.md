#### Pre class:

“Men were drowned in water only because they possessed the idea of gravity” (Marx, 1977: 160) is the most sarcastic criticism of idealism from a materialism point of view. However, men do create bicycles because they possessed the idea of a bicycle. Society are human creations and, even though there are physical constraints that limits how the society can be organised and they cannot be ignored, the practice of organising the society becomes how to properly perceive and manage these natural constraints so that they become the only constraints and not more dysfunctions that are created because of politics.



“Separate Individuals have, … become more and more enslaved under a power alien to them, a power which has become more and more enormous and, in the last instance, turns out to be the world market.” (Marx, 1977: 171)

The birth of socialism and communism is almost a result of the unacceptable reality that societies at the time started to become hostile to the majority. The modes of production has changed so that centralised production becomes a much more profitable and the major way of production. This caused a situation of the centralise of wealth, the separation of distinct class of people based on their level of wealth and ability to gain them. The people who controls the means of production becomes the most important power ruling the rest of society: corporatists have the power to decide how much a proletarian worker should earn through their hard work, these people are actual politicians. Different from politicians in the system which Max Weber pointed out to have the power but also equal responsibility of the changes they made, corporatists have great amount of power to make changes but their responsibility is relatively little. 





#### Post-class:

The capital-oriented corporation inherently put profit as their first priority. The most devastating consequence of this is the lack of regard for future, and hence they do not see much responsibility. Despite the potential of revolution, the most fundamental problem of capitalism is itself: the duality of working class were disregarded. The capitalism system has made workers become virtually bondsman to the capital class. However, most results of their work are not eventually consumed by the capital class, but themselves. This is a major reason Marx and many socialists calling workers to unite — they do not serve anyone but only themselves. When factory owners are competing for the lowest possible price, they inevitably will pay less to the worker resulting they cannot afford to buy anything they produce and an economy crisis will happen when this is on a massive scale. The for-profit nature of capitalism force the owner of corporations to be short-sighted and cannot handle this problem. In this perspective, a communism revolution can be seen as a union of worker’s duality — the duality of producer and consumer were united and no longer being managed externally by their employers, which is self-owning.

In recent years, this particular problem is addressed, as state would require minimum wage and workers can form unions to demand their rights. However this dualism nature of working class were still not being completely addressed, as the bourgeois still exist and make decision for workers.
